# Indexation
JetBrains test assignment.

## Things to imrove

- implement TODOs
- add terms transformer
- make it all type safe
- tests
- docs
- files filter
- compaction for the index (garbage collection)
- check all access modifiers
- add logging
- copy files and directories before indexing

## Notes

- it doesn't track deleted files and directories, so that if they will be recreated, they will no longer be indexed.
